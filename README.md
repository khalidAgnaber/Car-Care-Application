# Car-Care-Application

Your task is to implement the CarCare application in the following way:  

Implement the basic classes needed for this application as suggested by UML class diagram in the next page, no aggregations (multiplicity 0..* or 1..*) for the time being.  

Classes should show attributes, at least one constructor, getters and setters (when needed), behaviors, toString() behavior that returns a String representation of the state of an object  

If you need a date or timestamp object, use java.util.GregorianCalendar  

Identify packages and organize the classes in question (1) under these packages.  

Implement and use at least one enumerated type.  

Implement CarCareApp main class that creates two objects corresponding to any two classes in (1) and displays their state.  

You should have interaction with the user at the level of CarCareApp using java.util.Scanner to create the objects in question (4) 

Task 1:  

Add two custom exceptions to your solution. At least one of the exceptions should have a recovery behavior. 

Task 2:  

Create classes to manage the aggregations of objects needed by the system using the collections framework. Refer to the suggested UML class diagram in deliverable 2 requirements to finish your implementation.  

Examples of expected collection behaviors: add(), remove(), search(), sort(), toString() to print all the elements of the collection. 

Task 3:  

Update your testing application to account for thrown exceptions and allow the manipulation of the collections.
